  <h2>What is the dell xps</h2>
  <p>The XPS (Xtreme Performance System) name dates back to 1990 when Dell was more focused on corporate business than consumers. Gateway was number one in the high-end consumer market. In early 1993, there was a staff meeting to address how to
    pursue this emerging market. At this time, Dell's annual revenue was less than $500 million and Michael Dell was involved in most decisions. At this meeting, it was decided to launch a new high-end product line to compete with Gateway. Vernon
    Weiss was assigned as product manager to spearhead and manage the marketing of the new product. He worked with Brian Zucker who led the architecture and engineering effort. In September 1993, the first two versions of the XPS line were announced.
    The first generation of the XPS system was available as either a desktop or a tower case. This new product line was so far ahead of the competition that it was featured on the cover of the October 1993 issue of PC/Computing.
